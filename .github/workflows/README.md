**What it does:**
1. 🔍 Analyzes dependency changes in the PR
2. 🚨 Checks for known security vulnerabilities
3. ⚖️ Verifies license compatibility
4. 💬 Posts summary in PR comments

**Timeout:** 10 minutes

**Configuration:**

## 🛡️ CodeQL Security Analysis

**File:** [`codeql.yml`](./codeql.yml)

**Triggers:**
- Push to `main` branch
- Pull requests to `main` branch
- Weekly schedule (Mondays at 10:00 UTC)

**What it does:**
1. 🔍 Initializes CodeQL for JavaScript/TypeScript
2. 🏗️ Builds the project automatically
3. 🔎 Performs security and quality analysis
4. 📊 Uploads findings to GitHub Security tab

**Timeout:** 30 minutes

**Query Suite:** `security-and-quality`

**Languages:** `javascript-typescript`

**Required Secrets:** None

**Results:** Available in GitHub Security → Code scanning alerts

**⚠️ Important Setup Note:**
This is an **advanced** CodeQL configuration. You must:
- Use "Advanced" setup in GitHub settings (not "Default" setup)
- Default and Advanced setups cannot run simultaneously
- See [`docs/CODEQL_SETUP.md`](../../docs/CODEQL_SETUP.md) for detailed setup instructions
- If you see "analyses from advanced configurations cannot be processed when the default setup is enabled", follow the troubleshooting guide in CODEQL_SETUP.md

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### For Vercel Preview Deployments

To enable preview deployments, add the following secrets to your repository:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**
2. Add these secrets:
   - `VERCEL_TOKEN`: Get from [Vercel Account Settings](https://vercel.com/account/tokens)
   - `VERCEL_ORG_ID`: Find in Vercel project settings → General
   - `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID`: Find in Vercel project settings → General

### For GitHub Pages

1. Go to **Settings** → **Pages**
2. Set **Source** to "GitHub Actions"
3. The workflow will automatically deploy to `https://<username>.github.io/ScaleFlow/`

### For CodeQL Security Analysis

**⚠️ Important:** This repository uses **Advanced** CodeQL configuration. Follow these steps:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Code security and analysis**
2. Find the "Code scanning" section
3. **If default setup is enabled:** Click the dropdown and select "Advanced" (or "Disable" then set up advanced)
4. **If code scanning is not enabled:** Click "Set up" and select "Advanced" (not "Default")
5. The existing workflow (`.github/workflows/codeql.yml`) will be automatically recognized

**Common Error:** If you see "analyses from advanced configurations cannot be processed when the default setup is enabled":
- You must disable default setup and switch to advanced setup
- See detailed instructions in [`docs/CODEQL_SETUP.md`](../../docs/CODEQL_SETUP.md)

## 🛡️ Security Features

### Automated Security Scanning
- **CodeQL:** Deep semantic code analysis for vulnerabilities
- **Dependency Review:** Blocks PRs with vulnerable dependencies
- **License Compliance:** Ensures no GPL/AGPL licenses are introduced

### Best Practices Implemented
- ✅ Minimal permissions (principle of least privilege)
- ✅ Timeout limits on all jobs
- ✅ Concurrency controls to prevent resource waste
- ✅ Fail-fast on security issues
- ✅ Artifact retention policies
